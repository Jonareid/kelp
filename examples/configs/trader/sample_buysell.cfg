# this defines a "priceFeed" type, i.e. where to get the data from
# types supported:
#   crypto
#   fiat
#   fixed
#   exchange
#
# We take the values from both feeds and divide them to get the center price.

DATA_TYPE_A="exchange"
# the format is <exchange name>/<base-asset-code-defined-by-exchange>/<quote-asset-code-defined-by-exchange>
# currently we only support the following exchanges: "kraken"
DATA_FEED_A_URL="kraken/XXLM/ZUSD"

# sample priceFeed with the "crypto" type
#DATA_TYPE_A="crypto"
# this is the URL to a coinmarketcap feed which the bot understands.
#DATA_FEED_A_URL="https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/stellar/"

# this is a fixed value of 1 here because the exchange priceFeed provides a ratio of two assets.

# sample priceFeed with the "fiat" type.
#DATA_TYPE_B="fiat"
# you can use a service like apilayer.net to get prices for fiat if you want real-time updates. You will need to fill in the access_key in this url
