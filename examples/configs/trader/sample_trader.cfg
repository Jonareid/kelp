# the port that the monitoring server should run on. Uncomment the following line to add monitoring server.

# tls certificate for the server to use if HTTPS is desired. If left empty, then the monitoring server will default to
# HTTP. A valid certificate and key file can be obtained from a Certificate Authority - an example of one is Let's Encrypt.
# If you would like to generate one for local testing, you can run `mkcert localhost` (mkcert can be installed on MacOs and Linux).
# Note that this does NOT allow you to run a publicly-accessible TLS server and is for local development only.
# MONITORING_TLS_CERT="./localhost.pem"
# tls key for the cert. If left empty, then the server will default to HTTP.
# MONITORING_TLS_KEY="./localhost-key.pem"

# If you would like to use Google OAuth for the monitoring server, you have to register your app with Google
# and request a client ID and secret. For more info see: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2.
# When you register, you MUST configure the Authorized redirect URIs to something of the
# form "https://[hostname]:[MONITORING_PORT]/_googleauth". For testing locally, you can set it to "https://localhost:[PORT]/_googleauth"
# This gives the ability to secure monitoring endpoints by forcing clients to sign in using their Google accounts,
# and only acceptable emails will be allowed access (see below).
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""
# a comma-separated list of emails (Google accounts) that are allowed access to monitoring endpoints that require
